# Environment Variables Template
# 
# INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Create a file named `.env.local` in the project root (d:\resumio\Resumio\)
# 2. Get your API key from: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
# 3. Add this line to `.env.local`:
#
#    GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyABC123...your_actual_key_here
#
# 4. Restart the dev server (npm run dev)
#
# Note: .env.local is gitignored, so it won't be committed to version control

# For deployment (Vercel/Netlify):
# Add GEMINI_API_KEY as an environment variable in your deployment platform settings
